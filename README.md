# Smart Contract Vulnerabilities Analysis

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to identifying, analyzing, and mitigating vulnerabilities in smart contracts, specifically those written in Solidity for Ethereum and other blockchain platforms. The project utilizes a combination of static analysis, dynamic testing, and mitigation techniques to enhance the security and reliability of smart contracts.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into four main sections:

### 1. **Vulnerability Analysis**
- **Script**: `Vulnerability_Analysis.py`
- **Description**: Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on smart contract data to identify common security flaws such as reentrancy, overflow/underflow, and improper access control.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `analyze_reentrancy()`
  - `detect_overflows()`
  - `check_access_controls()`
- **Output**: Reports potential vulnerabilities and their locations in the code.

### 2. **Static Code Analysis using Slither**
- **Script**: `Static_Code_Analysis.py`
- **Description**: Utilizes the Slither tool to perform static code analysis, detecting vulnerabilities automatically.
- **Key Libraries**:
  - `slither`, `solc`
- **Output**: A detailed report of static analysis findings.

### 3. **Dynamic Analysis with MythX**
- **Script**: `Dynamic_Analysis_MythX.py`
- **Description**: Integrates with the MythX service to perform dynamic analysis and simulate attacks against the smart contracts.
- **Key Libraries**:
  - `mythx`, `web3.py`
- **Output**: Simulated attack results and vulnerabilities exploited during the simulation.

### 4. **Mitigation Techniques**
- **Script**: `Mitigation_Techniques.py`
- **Description**: Implements various mitigation techniques to address detected vulnerabilities, including coding best practices and security patterns.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - **Code Refactoring**: Suggestions for secure coding practices.
  - **Security Pattern Implementation**: Uses established security patterns to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- **Key Libraries**:
  - `solc`, `truffle`, `ganache`
- **Output**: Recommendations for improving smart contract security.

## Dataset
The repository includes example smart contracts that demonstrate typical vulnerabilities:

- **ReentrancyContract.sol**
- **OverflowUnderflowContract.sol**
- **AccessControlContract.sol**

These contracts are used to illustrate vulnerabilities and test the effectiveness of proposed mitigations.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sindhubommali01/Smart-Contract-Vulnerabilities.git
   cd Smart-Contract-Vulnerabilities

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
  Ensure required tools such as Truffle and Ganache are installed, along with node dependencies.

3. **Run the scripts**:
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   truffle test
   python Static_Code_Analysis.py
   python Dynamic_Analysis_MythX.py
   python Mitigation_Techniques.py

   ```

## Usage
- **Load the dataset**: Ensure that the example smart contracts are properly placed in the project's directories.
- **Modify code**: Adjust scripts as needed to test different contracts or implement additional security analyses.

## Results
Each script provides detailed insights into potential vulnerabilities, how they can be exploited, and how to effectively mitigate them.

## Future Work
- **Enhance Detection Algorithms**: Improve and expand the scope of detection mechanisms to cover emerging vulnerabilities.
- **Automate Testing Framework**: Develop a comprehensive testing framework that integrates with continuous integration systems
- **Expand Blockchain Compatibility**:  Extend analyses to include other blockchain platforms like Binance Smart Chain or Solana.
